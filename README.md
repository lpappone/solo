There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for each heading. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

## Heading ##
  Splitter: Create excerpts of record with the click of a button. 

## Sub-Heading ##
  Stop spending valuable attorney and support staff time managing compiling excerpts of record - let Splitter do it for you. 

## Summary ##
  You provide Splitter with a table of the page ranges you cite, your file name format, and the files' location.  It compiles your cited page ranges into the single pdf file that you need to submit to the court.  While Spitter does its work, your employees are free to devote their time to other tasks.  

## Problem and Solution ##
  Without splitter, compiling excerpts of record requires hours of human time spent opening pdfs, selecting pages, saving them with a new name, and later compiling all those individual files.  Other applications can help with part of the process, but still require a great deal of human time.  Splitter reduces human input to a minimum and does what computers do best, freeing your attorneys and support staff to do what they do best.  

<!-- ## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->

## Quote from You ##
  "Created by attorneys, for attorneys, Splitter solves a long-standing problem that no other product had fully addressed."

## How to Get Started ##
  Simply double-click and install the application as you would any other.  (May need to save in the same root directory as the pdf files, at least for version 1.)

## Customer Quote ##
  "This turned a day-long task into a 30-second one.  Thank you!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Install the package to your computer.  See the read-me for further instructions.
