  Splitter: Create excerpts of record with the click of a button. 

  Stop spending valuable attorney and support staff time managing compiling excerpts of record - let Splitter do it for you. 

  You provide Splitter with a table of the page ranges you cite, your file name format, and the files' location.  It compiles your cited page ranges into the single pdf file that you need to submit to the court.  While Spitter does its work, your employees are free to devote their time to other tasks.  

  Without splitter, compiling excerpts of record requires hours of human time spent opening pdfs, selecting pages, saving them with a new name, and later compiling all those individual files.  Other applications can help with part of the process, but still require a great deal of human time.  Splitter reduces human input to a minimum and does what computers do best, freeing your attorneys and support staff to do what they do best.
