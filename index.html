      <p><strong>Where are your record files?</strong> Your files must be pdf files (the end of the filenames should be ".pdf". In addition, your file names must somewhere contain the beginning and ending bates numbers contained in the file. You shouldn't have other pdf files in this same location, because that will confuse your computer.</p> 
      <input type="text" id="recordLocation"> or <button type="button" id="directoryBrowse">Browse...</button>   

      <p><strong>Where is your CSV file?</strong> Your cited ranges should be in a spreadsheet with two columns. There should be one row for each citation. The first column should be the start page number and the second column should be the end page number. If you have this saved as an excel spreadsheet, resave it as a .csv file instead.</p>  
      <input type="text" id="csvLocation"> or <button type="button" id="csvBrowse">Browse...</button>

      <p><strong>Where do you want your new files saved?</strong> Your excerpts of record file will be a pdf called "Excerpts_of_Record." We'll also produce a variety of files containing your cited ranges. (They may not match the ranges precisely, but don't worry, all your pages are there.) You can safely delete these files if you wish.</p>
